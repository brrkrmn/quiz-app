  Quiz App
  <br>
</h1>

Quiz App presents users with 10 randomly selected questions per attempt. Each question comes with a 30-second time limit, after which it is automatically skipped if unanswered. For the first 10 seconds, the answer options are disabled. Users cannot revisit previous questions once they've moved on. At the end of the quiz, results are displayed in a table format, providing a summary of performance.
